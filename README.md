# ASMR-generator

## Motivations
"Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is an experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. "  (Wikipedia)

ASMR has helped me fall asleep fast, searching videos of my favorite asmr youtubers is my main method to look after something unfamiliar to my brain yet matches my taste. This process can be time-consuming, therefore I have been thinking if there is any way to generate random asmr audios whose length is adjustible and sound sources selective.

This readme file serves as my project journal. 

## Sources
While youtube has a large group of creators working on ASMR, it is not easy to find downloadable sources. Here are some sources I listen to or use as an sample.

- [Massage ASMR](https://soundcloud.com/massageasmr) 
- [ASMR Bakery (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDH70xAv1bBeaCt5Cc7a96A)
